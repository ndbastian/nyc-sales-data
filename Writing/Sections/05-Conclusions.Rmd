## Future Research

This research has shown that the addition of spatial-lag features can increase the predictive accuracy of machine learning models above and beyond traditional spatial aggregation techniques. There are several areas that could be further explored regarding spatial lag features, some of which are mentioned below. 

First, it became apparent in the research that generalization was a problem for some of the models, likely due to overfitting of the training data. This issue was corrected by employing different algorithms, however, further work could be done to create variable selection processes and/or hyperparameter tuning to prevent overfit.

Additionally, the spatial lag features seemd to perform best for certain boroughs and for residential building types. One possible explanation for this is that these types of assetts are considerably more numerous and homogenous. We hypothesize that using a 500 meter radius to build spatial lag features, a distance which was arbitrarily chosen, works best for this type of asset in these areas. @Fotheringham2015 used an "Adaptive Bandwidth" technique to adjust the spatial lag radius based on cross-validation with much success. The techniques presented in this paper could be expanded to use cross validation in a similar manner to assign the optimal spatial lag radius for each building type and location.  

Finally, this research aimed to predict real estate transactions 1 year into the future. While this is a promising start, 1-year of lead time may not be sufficient to respond to growing gentirifaction challenges. In addition, modeling at the annual level could be improved to quartlery or monthly, given that the sales data contains date information down to the day. To make this system practial for combatting displacement, it may be helpful to predict at a more granular level and further into the future. 

## Conclusion

Gentification is largely beneficial to societies and communities, however, the downside should not be overlooked. Displacement causes Economic Exclusion, which over time can contribute to rising Income Inequality. Combatting displacement allows communities to benefit from gentrification without suffering the negative consequences. One way to practically combat displacement is to predict gentirification, which this paper has attempted to do.  

Spatial lags, typically seen in geographically weighted regression, were employed successfully to enhance the predictive power of machine learning models. THe spatial lag models performed best for particular building types and geographies, however, we feel confident that the techique could be expanded to work equally as well for all buildings with some additional research. Regarding algorithms, Artificaly Neural Networks performed the best for predicting sale price, while GBM performed best for predicting sale occurance.  

While this research is not intended to serve as a full early-warining system for gentrification and displacmenet, it is a step in that direction. More research is needed to help address the challenges faced by city planners and governments trying to help incumbent residents reap the benefits of local investments. Income inequallity is a complicated and grave issue, but new tools and tecnhiques to inform and prevent will help ensure equality of opportunity for all.
