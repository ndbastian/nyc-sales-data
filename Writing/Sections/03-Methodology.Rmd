## Data


## Algorithm

Random Forrest has several advantages over traditional geographic weighted regression, amoung them:

1. Ability to handle large amounts of categorical data without much pre-processing
2. Ability to model in spite of missing values in data
3. Eliminated colinearity as a concern
4. Allows for the introduction of many more variables without requiring penalty for additional predictors
5. Works relatively fast and can be parallelized
