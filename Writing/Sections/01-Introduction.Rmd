In this paper, we explore a technique for more accurately predicting real estate transactions, both their occurrence (probability of sale) and their dollar amount (sale price per square foot). We explain how this predictive technique may be applied to combat Economic Exclusion, a precursor to Income Inequality. The technique marries the use of machine-learning predictive models (Random Forrest) with "spatial-lag" features typically seen in geographically-weighted regressions (GWR). We find that, while the addition of many new variables to a modeling data set can inhibit the models' ability to generalize into the future, spatial-lag features 1) consistently outperform zip-code level aggregation features, and 2) outperform all models for specific types of properties in specific areas. We conclude that spatial-lag features, while computationally expensive, can be used to significantly increase the predictive accuracy of spatial predictive models.

## What is Economic Exclusion?

Income inequality may be a defining challenge of our time, yet the causes of inequality remain unclear. As discussed by @Zuk2015, "Neighborhoods change slowly, but over time [they] are becoming more segregated by income, due in part to macro-level increases in income inequality". Researchers at the Urban Institute [@urban2016] recently identified the socio-economic phenomenon of “Economic Exclusion” as an explanation for income inequality in the US. Economic Exclusion can be explained as follows: vulnerable populations--disproportionately communities of color, immigrants, refugees, and women--who are physically displaced by local economic prosperity can enter into a gradual cycle of diminished access to good jobs, good schools, health care facilities, public spaces, etc. Diminished access leads to more poverty, which leads to more displacement. Such self-reinforcing poverty gradually exacerbates income inequality over the course years and even generations.

## Predicting Gentrification

One practical way to combat Economic Exclusion is to focus on preventing displacement, i.e., the physical relocation of populations away from economic resources. As argued by @Clay1979, displacement is the negative consequence of gentrification. Predicting gentrification at an early stage, however, has proven to be a difficult task historically. When an area experiences economic growth, increased housing demands and subsequent affordability pressures can lead to voluntary or involuntary relocation of low-income families and small businesses. Government agencies and nonprofits tend to intervene once displacement is already underway, and after-the-fact interventions can be costly and ineffective. As explained by @urban2016, there are several preemptive actions that can be deployed to stem divestment and ensure that existing residents benefit from new investments. Not unlike medical treatment, early detection is the key to success. Consequently, in 2016, the Urban Institute put forth a call for research into the creation of “neighborhood-level early warning and response systems that can help city leaders and community advocates get ahead of neighborhood changes" [@urban2016]. This paper explores a technique to answer that call in part.
