\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\subsection{Background}\label{background}

Income inequality may be one of the most pressing challenges of our
time, yet, its causes remain unclear. As discussed by Zuk (2015),
``Neighborhoods change slowly, but over time {[}they{]} are becoming
more segregated by income, due in part to macro-level increases in
income inequality''. Researchers at the Urban Institute (Solomon Greene
and Lei 2016) recently identified the socio-economic phenomenon of
``Economic Exclusion'' as an explanation for income inequality in the
US.

Economic Exclusion can be defined as follows: vulnerable
populations--disproportionately communities of color, immigrants,
refugees, and women--who are physically displaced by local economic
prosperity can enter into a gradual cycle of diminished access to good
jobs, good schools, health care facilities, public spaces and other
physically proximate benefits. Diminished access leads to more poverty,
which leads to more displacement. Such self-reinforcing poverty
gradually exacerbates income inequality over the course years and even
generations.

One practical way to combat Economic Exclusion is to focus on preventing
displacement, i.e., the physical relocation of populations away from
economic resources. As argued by Clay (1979), displacement is the
negative consequence of gentrification. Predicting gentrification at an
early stage, however, has proven to be a difficult task historically.

When an area experiences economic growth, increased housing demands and
subsequent affordability pressures can lead to voluntary or involuntary
relocation of low-income families and small businesses. Government
agencies and nonprofits tend to intervene once displacement is already
underway, and after-the-fact interventions can be costly and
ineffective. As explained by Solomon Greene and Lei (2016), there are
several preemptive actions that can be deployed to stem divestment and
ensure that existing residents benefit from new investments. Not unlike
medical treatment, early detection is the key to success.

Consequently, in 2016, the Urban Institute put forth a call for research
into the creation of ``neighborhood-level early warning and response
systems that can help city leaders and community advocates get ahead of
neighborhood changes'' (Solomon Greene and Lei 2016). This paper
explores a technique to answer that call in part using free, open data
and open-source software.

Many government agencies have already become competant at using
predictive modeling to identify and address socio-economic challenges at
the individual-level, ranging from prescription drug abuse to
homelessness to recidivism (Ritter 2013). However, few, if any, examples
exist of large-scale, systematic applications of data analysis to aid
vulnerable populations experiencing displacement. This paper belongs to
an emerging trend known as the ``science of cities'' which aims to use
large datasets and advanced simulation and modeling techniques to
understand urban patterns and how cities function (Batty 2013).

In this paper, we explore a technique to more accurately predict real
estate transactions, both their occurrence (probability of sale) and
their dollar amount (sale price per square foot). We explain how this
predictive technique may be applied to practically combat Economic
Exclusion, a precursor and contributor to Income Inequality. The
technique marries the use of machine-learning predictive modeling (using
Random Forrest) with ``spatial-lag'' features typically seen in
geographically-weighted regressions (GWR). We find that, while the
addition of many new variables to a modeling data set can inhibit the
models' ability to generalize into the future, spatial-lag features 1)
consistently outperform zip-code level aggregation features, and 2)
outperform all models for specific types of properties in specific
areas. We conclude that spatial-lag features, while computationally
expensive, can be used to increase the accuracy of spatially-conscious
predictive models.

\section{Literature Review}\label{literature-review}

The literature review for this paper reviews the concept of Economic
Displacement as it has been addressed in academia, primarily in relation
to the study of gentrification. We also examine ``mass appraisal
techniques'', which are automated analytical techniques used for valuing
large numbers of real estate properties. Finally, we will briefly
examine machine learning as it relates to the problem of predicting
gentrification and/or Economic Displacement.

\subsection{How Has Economic Displacement Been Addressed in the
Past?}\label{how-has-economic-displacement-been-addressed-in-the-past}

Economic Displacement has been intertwined with the study of
gentrification since shortly after the latter became academically
relevant in the 1960's. The term ``gentrification'' was first used by
Ruth Glass in 1964 to described the ``gentry'' in low income
neighborhoods in London. Gentrification was originally understood as a
``tool of revitalization for declining neighborhoods'' (Zuk 2015),
however, in 1979 Phillip Clay made the distinction between two types of
revitalization: ``incumbent upgrading'' and ``gentrification'', noting
that Economic Displacement was the negative consequence of the latter
(Clay 1979). Today, the term has evolved to describe ``a spatial
organization and re-organization of human dwelling and activity'' (Zuk
2015). Specific to cities, gentrification is thought of as ``the
transformation of a working-class or vacant area of the central city
into middle-class residential or commercial use'' (Lees 2008).

Studies of gentrification and displacement generally take two approaches
in the literature: supply-side and demand-side, or ``the flows of
capital versus flows of people to neighborhoods'', respectively (Zuk
2015). Supply side arguments for gentrification tend to focus on
``private capital investment, public policies, and public investments''
(Zuk 2015). (Smith 1979) argued that the return of capital from the
suburbs to the city drives gentrification. He describes a ``political
economy of capital flows into urban areas'' (Zuk 2015) as largely
responsible for both the positive and negative consequences of
gentrification. According to (Dreier 2004), public policies that have
been linked to increased Economic Displacement have been, among others,
automobile-oriented transportation infrastructure spending and mortgage
interest tax deductions for home owners.

More recently, income inequality has been explored as a major
contributor to Economic Displacement, specifically, ``higher
compensation in the top quintile and the lack of jobs for the bottom
quintile'' (Reardon 2011); (Watson 2009). The concentration of wealth
allows ``certain households to sort themselves according to their
preferences -- and control local political processes that continue
exclusion'' (Reardon 2011). This results in a self-reinforcing feedback
loop where wealthier households influence public policy toward their
self interest. Gentrification prediction tools could be used to help
break such feedback loops through early identification and intervention.
Reardon (2011) also argues that ``were income inequality to stop rising,
the number of segregated neighborhoods would decline.''

Many studies conclude that gentrification in most forms leads to
exclusionary economic displacement, however, Zuk (2015) characterizes
the results of many recent studies as ``mixed, due in part to
methodological shortcomings''. In this paper, we attempt to further the
understanding of gentrification prediction by demonstrating a technique
to better predict real estate sales in New York City.

\subsection{A Review of Mass Appraisal
Techniques}\label{a-review-of-mass-appraisal-techniques}

Much of the research on predicting real estate prices has been in
service of creating mass appraisal models. Mass appraisal models are
most commonly used by local governments for the purpose of collecting
taxes from property owners. Mass appraisal models share many
characteristics with predictive machine learning models, in that they
are data-driven, standardized methods that employ statistical testing
(Eckert 1990). A variation on mass appraisal models are the ``automated
valuation models'' (AVM), which use ``often the same methodological
framework of mass appraisal\ldots{} a statistical model and a large
amount of property data to estimate the market value of an individual
property or portfolio of properties'' (d'Amato 2017).

Scientific mass appraisal models date back to 1936 with the reappraisal
of St.~Paul, Minnesota (Silverherz 1936). Since that time, and
accelerated with the advent of computers, much statistical research has
been done relating property values and rent prices to various
characteristics of those properties, including characteristics of their
surrounding area. Multiple regression analysis (MRA) has been the most
common set of statistical tools used in mass appraisal, including
Maximum Likelihood, Weighted Least Squares, and the most popular,
Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) (d'Amato 2017). The primary drawbacks of
MRA techniques are ``excessive multicollinearity among attributes'' and
``spatial autocorrelation among residuals'' (d'Amato 2017). Another
group of models that seek to correct for spatial dependence are known as
Spatial Auto Regressive (SAR) models, chief among them the Spatial Lag
Model, which aggregates weighted summaries of nearby properties in order
to create independent regression variables (d'Amato 2017).

Hedonic regression models generally seek to break down the price of a
good based on the intrinsic and extrinsic components. Koschinsky (2012)
is a recent and thorough discussion of parametric hedonic regression
techniques. Some of the variables included in Koschinsky's models are
derived from nearby properties, similar to the technique used in this
paper, and these variables were found to be predictive. The real estate
hedonic model as defined by Koschinsky describes the price of a property
as:

\[
\begin{aligned}
 P_i = P(S_i, N_i, L_i)
\end{aligned}
\]

Where \(P_i\) represents the price of house \(i\), which is a composite
good comprised of a vector of structural characteristics \(S\), a vector
of social and neighborhood characteristics \(N\), and a vector of
locational characteristics \(L\). Specifically, the model calculates
spatial lags on properties of interest using neighboring properties
within 1,000 feet of a sale. The derived variables include
characteristics like average age, quantity of poor condition homes,
percent of homes with electric heating, construction grade, etc. within
1,000 feet of the property in question. Koschinsky found that in all
cases, ``the relation between a home's price and the average price of
its neighboring homes is characterized by positive spatial
autocorrelation'' meaning that homes near each other were typically
similar to each other and priced accordingly. Koschinsky concluded that
locational characteristics should be valued at least as much ``if not
more'' than important structural characteristics.

As recently as 2015, much research has dealt with mitigating the
drawbacks of MRA, including the use of multi-level hierarchical models.
Fotheringham (2015) explored the combination of Geographically Weighted
Regression (GWR) with time-series forecasting to predict home prices
over time. GWR is a variation on OLS that allows for ``adaptive
bandwidths'' of local data to be included, i.e., for each estimate, the
number of data points included varies and can be optimized using
cross-validation.

Automated valuation modeling got a legal update in the aftermath of the
2008 financial crisis by way of the The Dodd Frank Act. In particular,
the Title XIV, subtitle F distinguishes the ``appraisal'' process from
automated valuation modelling, and reorganized both (d'Amato 2017). The
Act asserts that appraisal, or valuation conducted by a human being,
cannot be replaced by AVM. At current, AVM is ``increasingly adaptable
in describing real estate market behavior'' but has yet to supersede the
importance and necessity of local information and human evaluation.

\subsection{Has Machine Learning Been Applied to this Problem
Before?}\label{has-machine-learning-been-applied-to-this-problem-before}

Both Mass Appraisal techniques and Automated Valuation Modeling seek to
predict real estate prices using data and statistical methods, however,
traditional techniques typically fall short of reality. This is because
property valuation is inherently a ``chaotic'' process that does not
lend itself to binary or linear analysis (Zuk 2015). The value of any
given property is a complex combination of perceived value and
speculation. The value of any building or plot of land belongs to a rich
network where decisions about and perceptions of neighboring properties
influence the final market value. Guan et al. (2014) compared
traditional MRA techniques to alternative ``data mining techniques''
resulting in ``mixed results''. However, as Helbich (2013) states,
hedonic pricing models ``can be improved in two ways: (a) Through novel
estimation techniques, and (b) by ancillary structural, locational, and
neighborhood variables on the basis of Geographic Information System
(GIS)''. Recent research generally falls into these two buckets: better
analysis algorithms and/or better data.

In the ``better data'' category, researchers have been striving to
introduce new independent variables to increase the accuracy of
predictive models. Dietzell (2014) successfully used internet search
query data provided by Google Trends to serve as a sentiment indicator
and improve commercial real estate forecasting models. Pivo and Fisher
(2011) examined the effects of walkability on property values and
investment returns. Pivo found that on a 100-point scale, a 10-point
increase in walkability increased property investment values by up to
9\%.

Research into better prediction algorithms do not necessarily happen at
the exclusion of ``better data''. For example, Fu (2014) created a
prediction algorithm, called ``ClusRanking'', for real estate in
Beijing, China. ClusRanking first estimates neighborhood characteristics
using taxi cab traffic vector data, specifically as they relate to
accessibility to ``business areas''. Then, the algorithm performs a
rank-ordered prediction of investment returns segmented into five
categories. Similar to Koschinsky (2012), though less formally stated,
Fu (2014) thought of a property's value as a composite of individual,
peer and zone characteristics. In the predictive model, Fu includes
characteristics of the neighborhood (individual), the values of its
nearby properties (peer), and the prosperity of the affiliated latent
business area (zone) based on taxi cab data (Fu 2014).

Several other recent studies compare various ``advanced'' statistical
techniques and algorithms either to other advanced techniques or to
traditional ones. Most studies conclude that the advanced,
non-parametric techniques outperform traditional parametric techniques,
while several conclude that the Random Forest algorithm is particularly
well-suited to predicting real estate values.

Kontrimasa (2011) compares the accuracy of linear regression against the
SVM technique and found the latter to outperform. Schernthanner H.
(2016) compared traditional linear regression techniques to several
techniques such as krigging (stochastic interpolation) and Random
Forest. They concluded that the more advanced techniques, particularly
random forest, are sound and more accurate when compared to traditional
statistical methods. Antipov and Pokryshevskaya (2012) comes to a
similar conclusion about the superiority of Random Forest to real estate
valuation after comparing 10 algorithms: multiple regression, CHAID,
Exhaustive CHAID, CART, 2 types of k-Nearest Neighbors, Multilayer
Perceptron neural network (MLP), Radial Basis Function neural network
(RBF)), Boosted Trees and finally Random Forest.

Guan et al. (2014) compared three different approaches to defining
spatial neighbors: a simple radius technique, a k-nearest neighbors
technique using only distance and a k-nearest neighbors technique using
all attributes. Interestingly, the location-only KNN models performed
best, although by a slight margin. Park (2015) developed several housing
price prediction models based on machine learning algorithms including
C4.5, RIPPER, Naive Bayesian, and AdaBoost. By comparing the models'
classification accuracy performance, the experiments demonstrate that
the RIPPER algorithm, based on accuracy, consistently outperformed the
other models in the performance of housing price prediction. Rafiei
(2016) employed a restricted boltzmann machine (neural network with back
propagation) to predict the sale price of residential condos in Tehran,
Iran. Rather than focusing on predictive performance, their paper
focuses on computational efficiency. A non-mating genetic algorithm is
used for dimensionality reduction. The paper concludes that two primary
strategies help in this regard: weighting property sales by temporal
proximity (sales which happened closer in time are more important), and
also using a learner to accelerate the recognition of important
features. The paper compares this technique to several other common
neural network approaches and finds that while not necessarily the only
way to get the best answer, it is the fastest way to get to the best
answer.

Finally, it should be noted that many studies, whether exploring
advanced techniques, new data, or both, rely on aggregation of data by
some arbitrary boundary. For example, Turner and Snow (2001) predicted
gentrification in the Washington, D.C. metro area by ranking census
tracts in terms of development. K. Chapple (2009) created a
gentrification ``early warning system'' by identifying low income census
tracts in central city locations. Barry Bluestone \& Chase Billingham
(2010) analyzed 42 census block groups near rail stations in 12 metro
areas across the United States, studying changes between 1990 and 2000
for neighborhood socioeconomic and housing characteristics. All of these
studies, and many more, relied on aggregation of data at the
census-tract or census-block level. In contrast, this paper compares
boundary-aggregation techniques (specifically, aggregating by zip codes)
to spatial-lag techniques and finds the spatial lag techniques to
generally outperform.

\section{Methodology}\label{methodology}

Our goal is to compare the use of spatial lags as features in a machine
learning predictive model against traditional feature engineering
techniques. We will create three modeling data sets:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Base
\item
  Zip Code
\item
  Spatial Lag
\end{itemize}

We will then create 2 predictive models for each modeling data set,
using a different outcome variable for each:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  Probability of Sale. The probability that a given property in New York
  City will sell in a given year
\item
  Amount of Sale. Given that a property sells, how much is the sale
  value?
\end{enumerate}

There will be six predictive models built in total, as follows:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lllllll@{}}
\caption{Six Predictive Models}\tabularnewline

6 & Sale Price & Regression & Spatial Lag & Sale Price per SF &

\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

To accomplish this, we combine three open-source data repositories
provided by New York City via \url{nyc.gov} and
\url{data.cityofnewyork.us}. Our base modeling data set includes all
building records and associated sales information from 2003-2017.

Following the creation of the base modeling data, we create two
additional data sets through feature engineering: a ``Zip Code
features'' data set and a ``Spatial Lag features'' data set. The primary
goal of this study is to compare the predictive power of the spatial
lags vs.~the base and zip code features.

\subsection{Data}\label{data}

The New York City government makes available an annual data set which
describes all tax lots in the five boroughs. The Primary Land Use and
Tax Lot Output data set, known as
\href{https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/bytes-archive.page?sorts\%5Byear\%5D=0}{PLUTO},
contains a single record for every tax lot in the city along with a
number of building and tax-related attributes such as Year Built,
Assessed Value, Square Footage, number of stories, and many more. At the
time of this writing, NYC has made this data set available for all years
between 2002-2017, excluding 2008. For convenience, we also exclude the
2002 data set from our analysis because sales information is not
available for that year. Importantly for our analysis, the latitude and
longitude of the tax lots are also made available, allowing us to locate
in space each building and to build geospatial features from the data.

Ultimately, we are interested in sales transactions--both frequency, and
amount. Sales transactions are also made available by the New York City
government, known as
\href{http://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-annualized-sales-update.page}{NYC
Rolling Sales Data}. At the time of this writing, sales transactions are
available for the years 2003-2017. The sales transactions data contains
additional data fields describing time, place, and amount of sale as
well as additional building characteristics. Crucially, the sales
transaction data does not include geographical coordinates, making it
impossible to perform geospatial analysis without first mapping the
sales data to PLUTO.

Prior to mapping to PLUTO, the sales data must first be transformed to
include the proper mapping key. New York City uses a standard key of
Borough-Block-Lot to identify tax lots in the data. For example, 31 West
27th Street is located in Manhattan, on block 829 and lot 16, therefore,
its Borough-Block-Lot (BBL) is 1\_829\_16 (the 1 represents Manhattan).
The sales data contains BBL's at the building level, however, the sales
transactions data does not appropriately designate condos as their own
BBL's. Mapping the sales data directly to the PLUTO data results in a
mapping error rate of 23.1\%. Therefore, the sales transactions data
must first be mapped to another data source, the NYC Property Address
Directory, or
\href{https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Property-Address-Directory/bc8t-ecyu/data}{PAD},
which contains an exhaustive list of all BBL's in NYC. Once the sales
data is combined with PAD, the data can be mapped to PLUTO with an error
rate of 0.291\%.

After the Sales Transactions data has been mapped to PAD, it can then be
mapped to PLUTO. The sales data is normalized and filtered so that only
BBL's with less than or equal to 1 transactions in a year occur. The
final data set is an exhaustive list of all tax lots in NYC for every
year between 2003-2017, whether that building was sold, for what amount,
and several other additional variables.

Only building categories of significant interest are included in the
data. The following building types are included:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\caption{Building Types Included in Modeling Data}\tabularnewline
\toprule
Category & Description\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endfirsthead
\toprule
Category & Description\tabularnewline

A & ONE FAMILY DWELLINGS\tabularnewline
B & TWO FAMILY DWELLINGS\tabularnewline

F & FACTORY AND INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS\tabularnewline
G & GARAGES AND GASOLINE STATIONS\tabularnewline
L & LOFT BUILDINGS\tabularnewline
O & OFFICES\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

The data is further filtered to include only records with equal to or
less than 2 buildings per tax lot. The global filtering of the data set
reduces the base modeling data from 12,012,780 records down to
8,247,499.

\subsection{Feature Engineering}\label{feature-engineering}

\end{longtable}

A binary variable is created to indicate whether a tax lot has a
building on it (i.e., whether it is an empty plot of land or not). In
addition, building types are quantified by what percent of the square
footage belongs to the major property types: Commercial, Residential,
Office, Retail, Garage, Storage, Factory and Other.

Importantly, two variables are created from the Sales Prices: A
price-per-square-foot figure (``Last\_Sale\_Price'') and a total Sale
Price (``Last\_Sale\_Price\_Total''). Sale Price per Square foot
eventually becomes the outcome variable in one of the predictive models,
even though it is referred to as Sale Price. Further features are
derived which carry forward the previous sale price of a tax lot, if
there is one, through successive years. Previous Sale Price is then used
to create Simple Moving Averages (SMA), Exponential Moving Averages
(SMA), and percent change measurements between the moving averages. In
total, 69 variables are input to the feature engineering process and 92
variables are output. The final base modeling data set is 92 variables
by 8,247,499 rows.

\subsubsection{Zip Code Modeling Data}\label{zip-code-modeling-data}

The first of the comparative modeling data sets is the Zip code modeling
data. Using the base data as a starting point, several features are
generated to describe characteristics of the zip code where the tax lot
resides. A summary table of the Zip code level features is presented
below.

\end{longtable}

In general, the base model data features are aggregated to a zip code
level and attached to the individual observations, including SMA and EMA
calculations. Additionally, a second set of features are added, denoted
as ``bt\_only'', which filter only for tax lots of the same building
type. In total, the Zip code feature engineering process inputs 92
variables and outputs 122 variables.

\subsubsection{Spatial Lag modeling
data}\label{spatial-lag-modeling-data}

Spatial lags are variables created from physically proximate
observations. For example, taking the average building age from all
buildings within 100 meters of the tax lot in question would be a
spatial lag. Creating spatial lags presents both advantages and
disadvantages in the modeling process. Spatial lags allow for much more
fine-tuned measurements of a building's surrounding area. Knowing the
average sale price of all buildings within 500 meters of a building can
be much informative than knowing the sale prices of all buildings in the
same zip code. However, building spatial lags is computationally
expensive.

To build spatial lags for all 8,247,499 observations in our modeling
data, we created a spatial indexing technique that sped up the process
by allowing for parallelization of the operation. Since tax lots rarely
if ever move, we reduced the indexing task to 514,124 points (the number
of unique tax lots in New York City). Then, for each point, we
calculated and cached every other tax lot within 500 meters of that
building. The result was an origin-destination relationship graph that
connected each tax lot to its surrounding tax lots.

Next, we used the spatial index to create spatial lag features. One
advantage to using spatial lags is the rich number of potential features
which can be created. Spatial lags can be weighted based on a distance
function, i.e., physically closer observations can be given more weight.
For our modeling purposes, we created two sets of features: distance
weighted features (denoted with a ``\_dist``) and simple average
features (denoted with''\_basic``). SMA and EMA as well as percent
changes were also calculated. In total, the spatial lag feature
engineering process input 92 variables and output 194 variables. A
summary of the Spatial Lag features are presented in Table 6.

Temporal and spatial derivatives of the Spatial Lag features presented
in Table 5 are also added to the model, including: variables weighted by
euclidean distance (``dist''), basic averages of the spatial lag radius
(``basic mean''), Simple Moving Averages (``SMA'') for 2 years, 3 years
and 5 years, exponential moving averages (``EMA'') for 2 years, 3 years
and 5 years, and year-over-year percent changes for all variables
(``perc change''). For a complete list of Spatial Lag features, see
Appendix A.

\subsection{Outcome Variables}\label{outcome-variables}

The final step in creating the modeling data is to define the outcome
variables. For our purposes, we create two dependent variables:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Sold. Whether a tax lot sold in a given year. Used in the Probability
  of Sale classification model.
\item
  Sale Price. The price-per-square foot associated with a transaction,
  if a sale took place. Used in the Sale Price Regression model.
\end{itemize}

The following table describes the distributions of both outcome
variables:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}

\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Algorithm}\label{algorithm}

Previous works (see: Antipov and Pokryshevskaya (2012); also
Schernthanner H. (2016)) have found the Random Forest algorithm (Breiman
2001) suitable to prediction tasks involving real estate. While
algorithms exist that may marginally outperform Random Forest in terms
of predictive accuracy (such as neural networks and functional gradient
descent algorithms), Random Forest is highly scalable and
parallelizable, and therefore a natural choice for comparing different
feature engineering strategies (such as in this paper).

Random Forest can be used for both classification and regression tasks.
The Random Forest algorithm works by generating a large number of
independent classification or regression decision trees and then
employing majority voting (for classification) or averaging (for
regression) to generate predictions. Over a data set of N rows by M
predictors, a bootstrap sample of the data is chosen (n \textless{} N)
as well as a subset of the predictors (m \textless{} M). Individual
decision/regression trees are built on the n by m sample. Because the
trees can be built independently (and not sequentially, as is the case
with most functional gradient descent algorithms), the tree building
process can be executed in parallel across an arbitrary number of
computer cores. With a sufficiently large number of cores, the model
training time can be significantly reduced. This provides a highly
accurate, robust prediction model that avoids many of the drawbacks of
traditional parametric techniques, such as OLS.

The primary advantages to using Random Forest with real estate data are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Can handle an arbitrarily large number of variables while avoiding the
  curse of dimensionality associated with regression techniques.
  Increasing the number of predictors in a multiple regression can
  quickly lead to over-fitting.
\item
  Can accommodate categorical variables with many levels. Real estate
  data often contains information describing the location of the
  property, or the property itself, as one of a large set of possible
  choices, such as neighborhood, county, census tract, district,
  property type, and zoning information. Because factors need to be
  recoded as individual dummy variables in the model building process,
  factors with many levels will quickly encounter the curse of
  dimensionality in multiple regression techniques.
\item
  Appropriately handles missing data. Predictions can be made with the
  parts of the tree which are successfully built, and therefore, there
  is no need to filter out incomplete observations or impute missing
  values. Since much real estate data is self reported, incomplete
  fields are common in the data.
\item
  Robust against outliers. Because of bootstrap sampling, outliers
  appear in individual trees less often, and therefore, are reduced in
  terms of importance. Real estate data, especially with regards to
  pricing, tends to contain outliers. For example, the dependent
  variable in one of our models, Sale Price (see: Table 7), shows a
  clear divergence in median and mean, as well as a maximum
  significantly higher than the third quartile.
\item
  Can recognize non-linear relationships in data, which is useful when
  modeling spatial relationships.
\item
  Is not affected by co-linearity in the data. This is highly valuable
  as real estate data can be highly correlated.
\item
  The algorithm can be parallelized and is relatively fast compared to
  neural networks and functional gradient descent algorithms.
\end{enumerate}

To run the model, we have chosen the h2o.randomForest function from the
h2o R open source library. The h2o implementation of the Random Forest
algorithm is particularly well-suited for high parallelization. For more
information, see: \url{https://www.h2o.ai/}.

\subsubsection{Data Validation}\label{data-validation}

The goal of the predictive models are to be able to successfully predict
both the probability and amount of real estate sales into the near
future. As such, our models will use out-of-time validation to assess
performance. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:Train Test Validate} The models
will be trained using data from 2003-2015. 2016 modeling data will be
used during the model training process as cross-validation data.
Finally, we will score our model using 2017 as a held-out sample. Using
out-of-time validation should ensure that the models generalize well
into the immediate future.

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Sections/tables and figures/Train Validate Test} \caption{Out-of-time validation}\label{fig:Train Test Validate}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Variable Selection}\label{variable-selection}

For ease of processing and to improve the ability of the model to
generalize into the future, a variable selection step is added to the
modeling process. A Random Forest model is first trained on a 1\%
sub-sample of the modeling data. Variable importance of the resulting
model is calculated using the technique proposed by Friedman (2001),
i.e., for a collection of decision trees \([T_m]_{1}^{m}\):

\begin{flalign*}
  \hat{I_{j}^{2}} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M}\hat{I_{j}^{2}}(T_m)
\end{flalign*}

Where influence \(I\) for variable \(j\) is calculated as the sum of
corresponding improvements in squared-error for node tree \(T\). After
calculating variable importance for the model data subset, the variables
are rank-ordered by descending importance. Variables which account for
80\% of the total variable importance are chosen to advance to the model
training round on the full modeling data sets.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}\label{evaluation-metrics}

We have chosen evaluation metrics that will allow us to easily compare
the performance of the models against other models with the same outcome
variable. The classification models (Probability of Sale) will be
compared using Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). The regression models
(Sale Price) will be compared using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Both
evaluation metrics are common for their respective outcome variable
types, and as such will be useful for comparing within model-groups.

\subsubsection{Area Under ROC Curve
(AUC)}\label{area-under-roc-curve-auc}

A classification model typically outputs a probability that a given row
in the data belongs to a group. In the case of binary classification,
the value falls between 0 and 1. There are many techniques for
determining the cut off threshold for classification; a typical method
is to assign anything above a 0.5 into the ``1'' or positive class. An
ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) plots the True
Positive Rate vs.~the False Positive rate at different classification
thresholds; it is a measurement of the performance of a classification
model across all possible thresholds, and therefore sidesteps the need
to arbitrarily assign a cutoff.

Area Under the ROC Curve, or AUC measures the entire two-dimensional
area underneath the ROC curve. It is the integration of the curve from
(0,0) to (1,1), defined as \(AUC = \int_{(0,0)}^{(1,1)} f(x)dx\).

AUC provides a relatively standard measure of performance across all
possible classification thresholds, and can be interpreted as the
probability that the model ranks a random positive example more highly
than a random negative example. A value of 0.5 represents a perfectly
random model, while a value of 1.0 represents a model that can perfectly
discriminate between the two classes. AUC is useful for comparing
classification models against one another because they are both scale
and threshold-invariant.

One of the drawbacks to AUC is that is does not describe the trade-offs
between false positives and false negatives. In certain circumstances, a
false positive might be considerably less desirable than a false
negative, or vice-versa. For our purposes, we rank false positives and
false negatives as equally undesirable outcomes.

\subsubsection{Root Mean Squared Error}\label{root-mean-squared-error}

The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is a common measurement of the
differences between values predicted by a regression model and the
observed values. It is formally defined as
\(RMSE = \sqrt{ \frac{\sum_{1}^{T} (\hat{y}_t - y_t)^2}{T} }\), where
\(\hat{y}\) represents the prediction and \(y\) represents the observed
value at observation \(t\).

Lower RMSE scores are typically more desirable. An RMSE value of 0 would
indicate a perfect fit to the data. RMSE can be difficult to interpret
on its own, however, it is useful for comparing models with similar
outcome variables. In our case, the outcome variables (Sales Price per
Square Foot) are consistent across modeling data sets, and therefore can
be reasonably compared using RMSE.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Sale Price Model}\label{sale-price-model}

Using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as an evaluation metric of
predictive power, we find that the Spatial Lag modeling features
consistently outperform the Zip Code features, while the Base modeling
data tends to outperform both, as shown in the following Table (lower
RMSE is better):

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}
\caption{Sale Price Model RMSE For Validation and Test Hold-out
Data}\tabularnewline
\toprule
type & base & zip & spatial lag\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endfirsthead
\toprule
type & base & zip & spatial lag\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
Validation & 280.6 & 298 & 286.2\tabularnewline
Test & 287.8 & 300.6 & 297.9\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Interestingly, both the Spatial Lag modeling data and the Zip Code
modeling data are extensions of the Base data, yet the Base data tends
to generalize to the hold-out data sets better. From this, we make two
observations:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  Building characteristic data, which largely comprises the Base
  modeling data, are the most important for predicting building sale
  price per foot
\item
  The Zip Code and Spatial Lag models are suffering from over-fitting of
  the data, which is limiting their ability to generalize to the
  hold-out samples.
\end{enumerate}

It is possible that the over-fitting issue could be corrected through
hyper-parameter tuning of the algorithms, as well as implementing
stricter variable selection. Despite this, we can still safely conclude
that the Spatial Lag features are superior to the Zip Code features in
terms of predictive power.

Taking a closer look at the data, we find that the models have varying
performance across Building Types and Boroughs. Figure
\ref{fig:RMSE by boro and build type} shows RMSE by Model, faceted by
Borough across the y-axis and Building Type across the x-axis (See Table
2 for a description of building type codes).

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Sections/tables and figures/RMSE by boro and build type} \caption{RMSE By Borough and Building Type}\label{fig:RMSE by boro and build type}
\end{figure}

We make the following observations from Figure
\ref{fig:RMSE by boro and build type}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The Spatial Lag modeling data outperforms both Base and Zip Code in 6
  cases, notably for Type A buildings (One Family Dwellings) and Type L
  buildings (Lofts) in Manhattan as well as Type O Buildings (Office) in
  Queens
\item
  It is generally harder to predict sale prices in Manhattan than other
  Boroughs
\item
  The ``residential'' building Types A (One Family Dwellings), B (Two
  Family Dwellings), C (Walk Up Apartments) and D (Elevator Apartments)
  have generally lower RMSE scores compared to the non-residential types
\end{itemize}

If we rank the models by performance for each Borough, Building Type
combination, we find that the Spatial Lag models outperform the Zip Code
models in 72\% of cases. Table 9 shows the average ranking by model type
as well as the percent distribution by model type across rankings.

\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Probability of Sale Model}\label{probability-of-sale-model}

Similar to the results found in the Sale Price models, using Area Under
the ROC Curve (AUC) as an evaluation metric, we find the Spatial Lag
model performs better on the hold-out validation data compared to the
Zip Code modeling data, as shown in Table 10. The Base Modeling data
continues to outperform the Spatial Lag and Zip Code modeling data
overall, however, when broken down by Borough and Building Type, some
interesting patterns emerge.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}
\caption{Probability of Sale Models AUC}\tabularnewline

\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Looking at the predictions by the models made on the 2017 validation
hold-out data, we see the Spatial Lag model performs best of any model
for three out of five Boroughs: Manhattan, Bronx and Staten Island
(Table 11).

\end{longtable}

AUC faceted along the x-axis by Building Type and along the y-axis by
Borough. The coloring indicated by how much a model's AUC diverges from

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Sections/tables and figures/AUC by boro and build type} \caption{AUC By Borough and Building Type}\label{fig:AUC by boro and build type}
\end{figure}

We make the following observations about Figure
\ref{fig:AUC by boro and build type}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The Spatial Lag model outperforms all other models for Elevator
  Buildings (Type D), particularly in the Bronx
\item
  The Probability of Sale model tends to perform poorly in Manhattan
  vs.~other Boroughs
\item
  However, the Spatial Lag model performs well in Manhattan for the
  residential building types (A, B, C and D)
\end{itemize}

If we rank model the probability models' performance for each Borough
and Building Type, we see that the Spatial Lag models consistently
outperform the Zip Code models, as shown in Table 12.

\section{Conclusions and Future
Research}\label{conclusions-and-future-research}

\subsection{Future Research}\label{future-research}

This research has shown that spatial-lag features can be worthwhile
additions to machine learning predictive models in certain
circumstances. There are several areas that could be further explored
regarding spatial lag features, some of which are mentioned below.

First, it became apparent in the research that generalization was a
problem for the models overall, likely due to overfitting of the
training data. Further research into proper varibale selection could be
one remedy for such issues.

Additionally, the spatial lag features seemd to perform best for outer
boroughs (non-Manhattan) and for smaller, residential building types.
One possible explanation for this is that these types of assetts are
considerably more numerous and homogenous. It is possible that a 500
meter radius, which was arbitrarily chosen, works best for this type of
asset. Fotheringham (2015) used an ``Adaptive Bandwidth'' technique to
adjust the spatial lag radius based on cross-validation. research into
applying a similar technique to this research could be valuable.

Finally, this research aimed to predict real estate transactions 1 year
into the future. While this is a promising start, 1-year of lead time
may not be sufficient to respond to growing gentirifaction challenges.
In addition, modeling at the annual level could be improved to quartlery
or monthly, given that the sales data contains date information down to
the day. To make this system practial for combatting displacement, it
may be helpful to predict at a more granular level and further into the
future.

\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

Gentification is largely beneficial to societies and communities,
however, the downside should not be overlooked. Displacement causes
Economic Exclusion, which over time can contribute to rising Income
Inequality. Combatting displacement allows communities to benefit from
gentrification without suffering the negative consequences. One way to
practically combat displacement is to predict gentirification, which
this paper has attempted to do.

Spatial lags, typically seen in geographically weighted regression, were
employed successfully to enhance the predictive power of machine
learning models. The features suffered in some areas do to modeling and
data shortcomings, but overall we found that spatial lags outperform
zip-code level aggregations, and perform quite well for specific asset
types and geographic locations, particularly residential buildings
outside of Manhattan.

While this research is not intended to serve as a full early-warining
system for gentrification and displacmenet, it is a step in that
direction. More research is needed to help address the challenges faced
by city planners and governments trying to help incumbent residents reap
the benefits of local investments. Income inequallity is a complicated
and grave issue of our time, but new tools and tecnhiques to inform and
prevent give a hope for a more equitable future.
