\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\subsection{Introduction to my thesis}\label{introduction-to-my-thesis}

Income inequality may be a central challenge of our time. Researchers at
the Urban Institute recently identified the socio-economic phenomenon of
``Economic Exclusion'' as one compelling explanation for the recent rise
in inequality in the US. Vulnerable populations (disproportionately
communities of color, immigrants, refugees, and women), who are
displaced by localized economic prosperity enter into a gradual cycle of
diminished access to good jobs, good schools, health care facilities,
public spaces, etc. This systematic denial causes enduring and
self-reinforcing poverty over the course years and even generations
(Greene, et al. 2016), gradually entrenching income inequality and
general unrest.

One way to practically combat economic exclusion is to focus on
preventing displacement, however, detecting gentrification at an early
enough stage can be a daunting task. When an area experiences economic
growth, increased housing demands and subsequent affordability pressures
can lead to evictions of low-income families and small businesses.
Government agencies and nonprofits tend to intervene once displacement
is already underway, and after-the-fact interventions can be costly and
ineffective. There are a host of pre-emptive actions that can be
deployed to stem divestment and ensure that existing residents benefit
from new investments. Not unlike medical treatment, early detection is
key to success. Consequently, in 2016, the Urban Institute put forth a
call for research into the creation of ``neighborhood-level early
warning and response systems that can help city leaders and community
advocates get ahead of neighborhood changes.''

This paper explores novel techniques to predict gentrification in the
pursuit of combating displacement and economic exclusion. Modern
techniques of data mining, machine learning and predictive modeling are
applied to datasets describing property values and sale prices in New
York City. I explore the viability of using spatial lags, i.e.,
variables created from physically proximate observations, as features in
a machine learning predictive model.

\section{Literature Review}\label{literature-review}

\subsection{Lit Review}\label{lit-review}

The world has seen an unprecedented amount of geospatial data produced
in recent years (i.e., data that contain information about where an
observation exists or happened). Every day in the U.S., federal, state
and local government agencies are making their troves of geo-spatially
tagged data available for the benefit of the public. Adequate tools to
describe, explore and model such data are in short supply for the
data-journalists and data-activists who have become modern mechanisms of
public service. It is imperative that research be done and tools created
to better harness such data for commercial and public good.

Predictive modeling using spatial dependence has been employed
extensively in recent years, notably in Crime Prediction (Almanie et
al., 2015). However, a key deficiency of many spatial dependent models
are their use of arbitrarily defined geographic regions, such as zip
codes, political districts, police precincts, state lines,
neighborhoods, etc. which diminish and obscure potentially valuable
insights. Worse yet, many predictive models ignore and exclude spatial
dependence, violating one of the basic tenets of geography: the direct
relationship between distance and likeness (Miller, et al., 2015).

\subsection{sample citations}\label{sample-citations}

Sample Citation: (Antipov and Pokryshevskaya 2012) (see: Antipov and
Pokryshevskaya 2012, 33--35; also Antipov and Pokryshevskaya 2012, ch.~1
and \emph{passim})

A minus sign (-) before the @ will suppress mention of the author in the
citation. This can be useful when the author is already mentioned in the
text:

Antipov says blah (2012).

You can also write an in-text citation, as follows:

Antipov and Pokryshevskaya (2012) says blah.
